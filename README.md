# DNS64 for ruvchain network

A simple DNS64 proxy written in go based on [github.com/miekg/dns](https://github.com/miekg/dns)

Unlike 'regular' DNS64 servers, it does not return a 'white' IPv6 address even if one exists. However, if there is an AAAA record with the ruvchain address, it returns that specifically.
